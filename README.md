# Household Budget Tracker
The primary goal that this project seeks to solve is the common issue of balancing a budget across a multi-roommate household. This project is designed to simplify this process into a basic interactive web application that combines budget tracking tools with both a wishlist feature and a financial summary that allows for easy planning and executing of financial decisions across a household.
